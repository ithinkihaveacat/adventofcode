Welcome to the Advent of Code[^aoc] Kotlin project created by
[ithinkihaveacat][github] using the [Advent of Code Kotlin
Template][template] delivered by JetBrains.

This is very horrible code. I think I've used `reduce()` in every single
solution so far…

There's nothing in the Java/Kotlin directories, the action is all in
the JS (Android Studio was being annoying).

If you're lucky, running the code might more or less get you the part 2 output.
You'll probably need to modify the code, or uncomment some of it, to get the
part 1 output.

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] – An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-four days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
